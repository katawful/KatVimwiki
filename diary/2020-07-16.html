<p>
Had a migraine yesterday, wanted to get work done on my bookshelf.
Currently working on setting up Vim-startify.
Also need to do some work with Vimwiki.
</p>

<p>
Well I finished up some of the Vimwiki shit I wanted to get done.
I think I will edit the site CSS file to look better but I also don't know CSS at all.
</p>

<p>
I got part of the shelf finished. 
I kinda messed up and for got to add bevels so I gotta do that before the rest.
Oh well.
