The stripes can be fairly thick overall.

== Cabinet Doors for Bailey ==
She wants 16 cabinet doors, all painted white.
I don't have the sizes just yet.
I need to make some test pieces relatively soon, but I am waiting on the router table fence so I can actually build it.
The current plan is to use poplar and MDF.
I also need to figure out how to make a door at all using the cope & stick/rail & stile bits I bought from Lee Valley.
