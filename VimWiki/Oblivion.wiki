== Generic Menus Notes ==
Generic menus are a way for mod authors to create menus that behave like vanilla menus instead of relying on `MessageBox`.
Generic menus require the following xml setup:
{{{class="brush: xml"
<menu name="MenuName">
  <class> &GenericMenu; </class>
  <stackingtype> &no_click_past; </stackingtype>
  <explorefade> 0.25 </explorefade>
</menu>
}}}
The name can be whatever, without spaces, and the class must always be `GenericMenu`.
The `explorefade` and `stackingtype` traits must have those values.
A generic menu can contain any valid menu traits, and can be built how the author desires.
It has menu type `1011` and must be contained in `Data\Menus\Generic\`.

The generic menu is called with `ShowGenericMenu "path\to\menu.xml" closingID(int)`.
The closing ID is the menu element that uses said ID.
It is optional, if not provided than any ID above 0 will close the menu when clicked/interacted.

The vanilla game uses the executable to control all menus, thus we need to script all features ourselves.
The use of menu event handlers is incredibly important and determines how we can control said menu.
It is called with `SetMenuEventHandler` and has specific handlers it can take.
These handlers requires specific parameters for the functions that get called however:
|     Name      |             Parameters              |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
|   `OnOpen`    |           `menuType:int`            |
|   `OnClose`   |           `menuType:int`            |
|   `OnClick`   | `menuType:int, tile:string, id:int` |
| `OnMouseover` | `menuType:int, tile:string, id:int` |

The functions for these handlers must contain the parameters in order to work, even if they're being used.
For example:
{{{
scn DemoMenuMouseover
int menu
string_var tile
int id
Begin Function {menu, tile, id}
  SetDebugMode 1
    DebugPrint "menu: %g tile: %z id: %g", menu, tile, id
  SetDebugMode 0
End
}}}

{{{
scn DemoMenuEventHandler
ref rEventScript
Begin Function {}
  set rEventScript to DemoMenuScrollHandler
  SetMenuEventHandler "OnClick", rEventScript, 1011
End
}}}
